| **Operating System** | Windows 10 (64-bit, Version 1903 or higher) | Windows 11 (64-bit) *for best UI effects* |

## ⚠️ OS Compatibility & UI Warning

> [!WARNING]
> **Visual Effects (Mica/Acrylic) Compatibility Notice:**
> * **Windows 11:** Fully supported. The application features dynamic Mica and Acrylic blur effects that sync beautifully with your system theme and wallpaper.
> * **Windows 10:** Due to operating system architectural limitations, these advanced blur effects **cannot be rendered**. 
>   * *What happens?* The interface will automatically fallback to a flat, solid dark theme. 
>   * *Why?* This ensures the application remains highly performant, lightweight, and completely free of lag or visual glitches on older Windows environments.

*Note for Windows 11 users: If the transparency effects do not appear, make sure that **Transparency effects** is toggled ON in your OS settings (`Settings > Personalization > Colors`).*
